This repository is to publicly store my website and allow access from other students for testing.
Cloned the "username.github.io" repository to my computer using GitHub Desktop.
Added my website files to the local repository folder.
Used GitHub Desktop to commit my changes with a summary and pushed them to GitHub by clicking "Push origin" in the top right corner.
